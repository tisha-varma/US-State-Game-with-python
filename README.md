U.S. States Quiz Game
The U.S. States Quiz Game is an interactive and educational game created using Python and the Turtle and Pandas libraries. The objective of the game is to test the player's knowledge of the U.S. states by having them input state names correctly on a blank map of the United States.

How It Works

Gameplay:
The game starts with a blank map of the U.S. displayed on the screen.
The player is prompted to enter the name of a U.S. state.
If the state name is correct, a marker is placed on the map at the state's location, displaying its name.


Score Keeping:
The player's score is updated in real-time and shown as current_score/50 Correct at the top of the prompt window.
The game continues until the player correctly names all 50 states or chooses to exit.

Exiting the Game:
If the player types "Exit," the game ends.
The program creates a "states_to_learn.csv" file containing a list of states the player missed during the game. This helps the player identify and learn the states they need to work on.

Additional Feature:
A hidden functionality allows players to find the (x, y) coordinates of any location on the map by clicking on it. This is useful for customizing or creating new games with a different map.

Why It's Fun and Educational
- Learning Tool: The game offers a fun way to learn U.S. geography and state locations.
- Interactive and Engaging: The use of a blank map and live scoring keeps players immersed.
- Customizable: Developers can easily adapt the game for other quizzes, such as identifying locations in different countries like India.
- Potential for Adaptation
- The structure can be easily modified for quizzes on other topics, including capitals, landmarks, or rivers.
For example, using this game as a reference, you could create an India Quiz to identify Indian states on a map, adding similar functionalities and features.
